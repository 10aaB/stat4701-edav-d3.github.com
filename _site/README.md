# from Shapefile to TopoJSON (and some GeoJSON) using GDAL/OGR

# Agenda

1. Introduction
2. Flu Data
3. D3 Examples and Inspiration


X. Maybe a demo that people can follow to do a very basic d3 map (maybe not, seems like this browser issues and others could be a huge pain)
X. Maybe do something with CartoDB at the end. If no one else is talking about it, it could be useful to at least mention and show a few things.
